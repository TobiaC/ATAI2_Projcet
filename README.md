A STRIPS domain has been invented and implemented in PDDL, a simplified version of the domain has been implemented in K language. Then, reverse plans are computed using clingo, eclingo, plas and quasp.

TODO
- use RevPlan tool to computer reverse plans for the K implementation.
- expand K implementation
